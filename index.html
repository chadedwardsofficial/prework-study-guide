          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language"</li>
              <li>HTML is considered the foundation for all webpages, it provides structure to the webpage.</li>
              <li>Every html document starts with a " !DOCTYPE in <>" </li>
              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
              <li>There are 6 types of headers varying in size. These will be in ascending order ex. H1..H2..H3.. with H1 being the largest and thusfore. These will be wrapped in "<>"</li>
              <li>Elements such as "Body" and "Head" are commonly referred to as <em>Parent Elements</em> and all elements within these tags are considered their <em>Child Elements.</em></li>
              <li>To represent a body of text or a paragraph; you use p in <> brackets.</li>
              <li>Semantic elements are elements where the name describes its content and role it plays within the webpage. For example: header, footer, main, section. </li>
              <li>To make an unordered list of items you use the tag "ul" in <> brackets. Inbetween these tags you then use a smaller tag to make your bulleted point list using "li" in <> brackets.</li>
              <li>The same list can be made using numbers which is considered an "Ordered List"; in which this case we would use "ol" in <> tags.</li>
              <li>You can also insert images and hyperlinks.</li>
              <li>Image insert codes goes as follows: img src="insert-link-to-img" in a pair of <>Brackets. Within the "" you will paste your link to code wether it be a .png file or a link to another website's image.</li>
              <li>To insert a hyper link, we use the "a" anchor tag.  a href="url-of-website". href= is a code to refer to the link you are sending the user to. The entire code will also be wrapped in <> brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a comprehensive language that adds style and more visual appeal to a website.</li> 
           <li>CSS has three different ways you can implement style into the code:</li>
              <ul>
                    <li> Inline: placing the css properties within the element tag itself.</li>
                    <li>Internal: storing the css properities inside the HTML file inside the head element</li>
                    <li>External: keeping all css rules and properties in a seperate file that later becomes to linked to the main HTML file.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>CSS rules take a property such as "width" and gives value to the proerty such as "50px". So this would read as width: 50px for example.</li>
              <h5>CSS attributes:</h5>
                <ul>
                      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
                      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
                      <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declerations will apply.</li>
                      <li>Declerations are both the properties and values together. You can also add more than one property/value to a selector by adding a "," inbetween each decleration.</li>

       <h2>Git</h2>
       <ul>
          <li>Git is a commonly used CLI (Command Line Interface) software that allows the user to track changes in their computer files by using Version Control</li>
          <li>Version Control is a great way in which developers can keep track of every iteration of their code so they can track their mistakes in current or past codes.</li>
          <li>Git uses basic coded language to help navigate through your directory on a text based level. Similarly to how we navigate a folder on our desktop, that is done through a visual way also known as GUI (Graphical User Interface)</li>
          <li>Using git allows a developer to also interact with GitHub, a database online that helps all collaboraters work together on a project.</li>
          <li>Git has basic commands such as:</li>
              <ul>
                    <li>ls: list of directories</li>
                    <li>cd "name of file": takes you to named file directory</li>
                    <li>pwd:print working directory</li>
                    <li>mkdir "name of file": makes a new directory in your listed using the name you inserted after mkdir.</li>
              </ul>
           <li>There are many more commands for Git that also allow you to clone(copy), modify and push repositories to the GitHub Database.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
             <li>JavaScript gives functionality to a webpage. It calls upon functions and allows you to ineract with the browser. </li>
             <li>In Javascript we give variables a value, for example: To list the shapes in the console log we would code
               var shapes = ["circle", "triangle", "square"].
             </li>
             <li>Once we have given a variable a value, we can call upon that same variable later on in a function. <br>For example: <br>
            
              function listShapes(){
                (var x = 0; x < topics.length; x++) {
                  console.log(topics[x]);
                 }
             </li>
             <li>A Function is a common tool used in JavaScript. This particular code gives the computer a set of instructions. Unlike if statements and for Loops where they are automatically deployed when you load the file; Functions are only executed when they are called upon.</li>
